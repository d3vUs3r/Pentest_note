In order to use the PsExec tool, you need to have administrative privileges on the remote computer that you want to connect to. If you don't have administrative credentials for the remote computer, you won't be able to use PsExec to execute commands or launch programs on that machine.
psexec \\remotecomputer -u administrator -p password cmd.exe

winexe -U DOMAIN\username%password //remote_computer "command"

AMSIProviders:
AMSIProviders refers to the Antimalware Scan Interface (AMSI) providers that are registered on a Windows system. 
The AMSI provides a way for applications to send content to registered AMSI providers, which will then scan the content and return a result 
indicating whether the content is malicious or not.
AMSI providers can be implemented by antivirus software vendors or other security software providers.

AppLocker:
AppLocker is a Windows feature that allows system administrators to define rules and policies that control which applications can run on a system.
AppLocker can help enhance the security of a Windows environment by preventing users from running unauthorized or malicious applications,
which can help reduce the risk of malware infections and other security threats

Credential Guard:
Credential Guard is a security feature available on Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows Server 2016 that helps protect against credential theft attacks, such as Pass-the-Hash and Pass-the-Ticket.
It accomplishes this by using virtualization-based security to isolate and protect secrets such as Kerberos tickets and NTLM hashes.

Credential Guard is designed to work in conjunction with other security features, such as Device Guard and BitLocker,
to provide a comprehensive security solution for Windows systems.

Credential Guard addresses this issue by using virtualization-based security to create a secure environment for storing and processing credentials.
Specifically, it uses a virtualized container called the Isolated User Mode (IUM) to store sensitive information, such as Kerberos tickets and NTLM hashes.
The IUM is isolated from the rest of the operating system, making it much more difficult for attackers to access these credentials.

Windows Default share:
    ADMIN$: The ADMIN$ share is a default administrative share that is created on every Windows computer. It provides remote administrative access to the Windows folder on the system. This share is usually only accessible by administrators who have been granted the necessary permissions to manage the system remotely.

    C$: The C$ share is also a default administrative share that is created on every Windows computer. It provides access to the root of the C drive on the system. This share is typically only accessible by administrators who have been granted the necessary permissions to manage the system remotely.

    IPC$: The IPC$ share is a special hidden share that is used for interprocess communication between computers on a network. This share is usually used by Windows services and applications to communicate with other computers and devices on the network.

    Users: The Users share is a default share that is created on every Windows computer. It provides access to the Users directory on the system, which contains user profiles and data for each user account on the computer.

WSUS:

WSUS (Windows Server Update Services) is a Microsoft tool that allows system administrators to manage and distribute updates and patches for Microsoft products to computers running Windows operating systems. By using WSUS, administrators can centralize the distribution of updates and ensure that all Windows-based computers on the network are up to date with the latest security updates, bug fixes, and feature enhancements.
WSUS allows administrators to approve or decline updates before they are distributed, monitor update installations, and generate reports on update status.
