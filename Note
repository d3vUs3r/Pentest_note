In order to use the PsExec tool, you need to have administrative privileges on the remote computer that you want to connect to. If you don't have administrative credentials for the remote computer, you won't be able to use PsExec to execute commands or launch programs on that machine.
psexec \\remotecomputer -u administrator -p password cmd.exe

winexe -U DOMAIN\username%password //remote_computer "command"
